# NanoGPS - Arduino Nano GPS Speedometer
With this code, you can connect an Arduino Nano with a NEO-6M GPS Module to get speed data, and display this on a simple 7-segment display.

## Features
- Shows current speed in km/h once it locks onto satellites.
- Loading animation while attemping to lock onto satellites.
- Since it uses hardware serial communication, we can utilize a cheap 7-segment display without the flickering that software serial would cause.
